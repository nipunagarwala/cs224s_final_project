OVERALL QUALITY (TOTAL SUB-SEGMENTS)
        audible     whispered     silent
word    4.6  (62)   3.8  (65)     3.4  (57)
phone   3.6 (194)   0.8  (194)    0.2 (188)

In the above, I've rated each sentence holistically according to its sub-segments on the following scale:
5: excellent (perfect)
4: good (mostly perfect, 1 or 2 errors)
3: fair (has repeated mistaggings but is understandable)
2: poor (medium-length subsegments are misstagged)
1: awful (not understandable; long-length segments are entirely misstagged)
0: zilch (almost entirely garbage -- any correctness seems random)

I've averaged the scores of 5 sentences of each type to estimate the quality of tags (30 sentences total).

Qualitative examples are available on Google Drive and in context/sampled.txt.

note the accented English means that the there is noise in the labels -- e.g., ao isn't produced as ao, uh isn't produced as uh, and so on.

also note that there is correlation between bad phone labels and bad word labels -- the sampled examples with more phone problems also have more problems with words, and vice versa

 phone silent - 0.2 quality, 188 segments
extremely hard to tell.
008_003_0247 SHE'S RIGHT OVER HERE
    awful: iy | h iy (but the sequence seems to match up)
008_002_0206 FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS ARE TREATING THEM LIKE SUSPECTS
    zilch: the sequence of phones detected makes no sense -- pieces get repeated like "dh-m-dh-eh-m-sil-unk" (and like in that example, the phone sequence doesn't end where the sentence does)
004_001_0221 STRATEGY CAME YESTERDAY AFTER HE MET WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS IN WASHINGTON
    zilch: ae and t sound influenced by s, axr is way too long, hh is way too long, w is waaaay too long; the sequence of phones doesn't make sense toward the end
004_001_0228 THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ADMITTED HIS PARTY HAS A PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM ON MINIMUM WAGES
    zilch: the sequence of phones detected doesn't map to the sentence provided; axr way too long, m, t way too long, 
008_003_0232 YOU ARE MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I AM
    zilch: t | s, dh | I am, phone sequence doesn't make sense
